Author: Johan Bengtsson

Self-Consistent Symplectic Integrator for charged particle beam dynamics.

The symplectic integrator for realistic modeling of magnetic lattices for
ring-based synchrotrons was initially implemented in Pascal, by the author,
with care taken for the software architecture and resulting records/modules
(-> "objects") to reflect the structure of the mathematical objects describing
the underlying beam dynamics model.


The symplectic integrator for RADIA kick maps was implemented by Laurent
Nadolski, SOLEIL, 2002.

The original Pascal library/code was machine translated to C (with p2c) by
Michael Boege, SLS, 1998.
